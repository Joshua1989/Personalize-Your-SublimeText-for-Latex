# BracketHighlighter 2.14.0

## New

- Tag detection settings regex patterns are all exposed in `bh_tag.sublime-settings`.
- Tag modes are no longer limited to just `xhtml`, `html`, and `cfml`.  Non-standard HTML tag support can be configured in the settings files. Read http://facelessuser.github.io/BracketHighlighter/customize/#tag-plugin-settings to learn more.
- Some existing tag settings have been removed and/or altered in favor of more flexible settings. Read http://facelessuser.github.io/BracketHighlighter/customize/#tag-plugin-settings to learn more.  If you were using some of the affected settings, you may need to update your user settings.

## Fixes

- Regression where non-xhtml modes could not handle HTML attributes which where not quoted.

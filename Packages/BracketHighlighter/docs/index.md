# BracketHighlighter {: .doctitle}
A bracket matcher and highlighter for Sublime.

---

## Overview
Bracket Highlighter matches a variety of brackets such as: `[]`, `()`, `{}`, `""`, `''`, `#!xml <tag></tag>`, and even custom brackets.

This was originally forked from pyparadigm's _SublimeBrackets_ and _SublimeTagmatcher_ (both are no longer available).  I forked this to fix some issues I had and to add some features I had wanted.  I also wanted to improve the efficiency of the matching.

Moving forward, I have thrown away all of the code and have completely rewritten the entire code base to allow for a more flexibility, faster, and more feature rich experience.

- Bracket plugins that can jump between bracket ends, select content, remove brackets and/or content, wrap selections with brackets, swap brackets, swap quotes (handling quote escaping between the main quotes), fold/unfold content between brackets, toggle through tag attribute selection, select both the opening and closing tag name to change both simultaneously.

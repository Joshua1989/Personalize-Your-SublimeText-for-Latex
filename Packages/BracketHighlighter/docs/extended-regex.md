# Extended Regex Guide {: .doctitle}
An introduction to backrefs.

## Overview
BH uses Python's re regex engine, but it also adds some additional back references to aid in the creation of bracket patterns.  This is done with a custom wrapper called backrefs that was originally written for [RegReplace](https://github.com/facelessuser/RegReplace).

Backrefs was written to add various additional backrefs that are known to some regex engines, but not to Python's re.  Backrefs adds: `\p`, `\P`, `\u`, `\U`, `\l`, `\L`, `\Q` or `\E` (though `\u` and `\U` are replaced with `\c` and `\C`).

You can read more about backrefs' features in the [backrefs documentation](https://github.com/facelessuser/sublime-backrefs/blob/master/readme.md).

### Getting the Latest Backrefs
It is not always clear when Package Control updates dependencies.  So to force dependency updates, you can run Package Control's `Satisfy Dependencies` command which will update to the latest release.


### Using Backrefs in BracketHighlighter Plugins
You can import backrefs into a `bh_plugin`:

```python
from backrefs as bre
```

Backrefs does provide a wrapper for all of re's normal functions such as `match`, `sub`, etc., but is recommended to pre-compile your search patterns **and** your replace patterns for the best performance; especially if you plan on reusing the same pattern multiple times.  As re does cache a certain amount of the non-compiled calls you will be spared from some of the performance hit, but backrefs does not cache the pre-processing of search and replace patterns.

To use pre-compiled functions, you compile the search pattern with `compile_search`.  If you want to take advantage of replace backrefs, you need to compile the replace pattern as well.  Notice the compiled pattern is fed into the replace pattern; you can feed the replace compiler the string representation of the search pattern as well, but the compiled pattern will be faster and is the recommended way.

```python
pattern = bre.compile_search(r'somepattern', flags)
replace = bre.compile_replace(pattern, r'\1 some replace pattern')
```

Then you can use the complied search pattern and replace

```python
text = pattern.sub(replace, r'sometext')
```

or

```python
m = pattern.match(r'sometext')
if m:
    text = replace(m)  # similar to m.expand(template)
```

To use the non-compiled search/replace functions, you call them just them as you would in re; the names are the same.  Methods like `sub` and `subn` will compile the replace pattern on the fly if given a string.

```python
for m in bre.finditer(r'somepattern', 'some text', bre.UNICODE | bre.DOTALL):
    # do something
```

If you want to replace without compiling, you can use the `expand` method.

```python
m = bre.match(r'sometext')
if m:
    text = bre.expand(m, r'replace pattern')
```
